# Streakosaur

This is a macOS application (I do plan to target iOS in the future, but for now it is macOS-only) to track your streaks. The idea of this application is to abandon the idea of binary streaks: instead of saying that you have a 20 days streak, it just tells what is your completion rate. E.g. missing a day during 20 days is not the end of the world, unless you really want to have 100% rate.

This is a SwiftUI application, for data storage it uses SQLite via GRDB.
